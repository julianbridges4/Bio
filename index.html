				<p>I was born and raised in Shelby, North Carolina to Jay and Carol Bridges on Febuary 22, 1992.  I grew up playing baseball and had many interests.  I went to college at Wofford College to play baseball, but didn't know what I would study as I had an interest in architecture but that wasn't offered there.  I eventually transferred to Limestone College where I became a biology major and started 3 years at shortstop playing baseball.  After graduating from Limestone, I found myself not knowing what I wanted for a career.  Lost and confused, I decided to go to work at my famiily's barbecue restaurant.</p>
				<p>After six months of working as a dishwasher, I was determined to find my career path and decided to intern at a local IT company.  Four months later, I applied and was accepted into a coding bootcamp in downtown Raleigh and moved here to persue a career as a developer.  Initially, I didnt' have any luck finding a developer job and took what I could working in IT as a Help Desk Analyst.  Now I am trying to revamp my skills and learn through UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp.  I am excited about how the future will unfold.  TO BE CONTINUED...</p>
